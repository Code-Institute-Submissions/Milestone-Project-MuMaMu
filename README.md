Mu-Ma-Mu


This website has been created with the purpose of creating a platform for female artists, who wish to collaborate and/ or perform togther.
It is a place where you can find educational information concerning women in the Music Industry, as well as yourself submit articles of interest.
If you a consumer wishes to find an all female band, act, duo, then here is where they would find a vast database of Musicians living in Málaga who
have experience and who have worked togther.

UX
This Website is for:
Female Musicians
Blog Collaborators interested in the topic.
Consumers - Music Lovers who wish to contact/ follow and hire.

This project is essentially an information platform where Interested Person (IP)X who are visiting if they for example
already been to see the mentioned musicians at an event and wanted to follow them & find out some more information.

It is also meant to be IP Y, who is perhaps interested in collaborating with information about 
female musicians education, development & career progression. IP Z, is the muscian who wants to form part of the team.
Is an active muscian already or who is hoping to form a collaboration for an event.

TESTING

I have used google Dev tools to inspect my pages and have seen that there are some layout errors with the margins- this is something 
that I will correct. 
Also I have not included a Favi-con on the pages, so that also shows as an error.
On 2 of my pages the ´footer´ does not extend to the full width of the vh and the icons from Font-awesom are not functioning correctly.

Deployment

I deployed this project to Github, and had several issues updating the repository. Also I tried to re-set the<head>
which didn´t seem to work, however, later it would not let me save my files to my branch. So I created this new repository & downloaded/uploaded all the files
again. Therefore not all my ´git commit´ history is present.
